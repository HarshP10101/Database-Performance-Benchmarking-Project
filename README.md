# Database-Performance-Benchmarking-Project
This project involved creating three databases of different sizes (A3Small.db, A3Medium.db, A3Large.db) from a provided database and populating them with data from .csv files. The performance of different queries was benchmarked under three scenarios: Uninformed, Self-optimized, and User-optimized, which involved varying the use of primary and foreign keys and SQLiteâ€™s auto-indexing. Four distinct queries were executed under each scenario, with each query being run 50 times to collect average running times and minimize the effect of caching and cold-start. The project concluded with the production of charts showing the performance (query execution time) for each query in each scenario for each database size. This project provided insights into how varied the performance of a DBMS can be depending on its setup.
